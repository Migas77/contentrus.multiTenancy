You should create azure_username.txt and azure_password.txt file with the credentials for your azure account where you have azure blob storage configured.

You should also add an ssh private key for the github repo containing the tenant configuration yaml files. In our case, we are using the following github repo: https://github.com/Migas77/contentrus.multiTenancy.argocdHelmCharts
